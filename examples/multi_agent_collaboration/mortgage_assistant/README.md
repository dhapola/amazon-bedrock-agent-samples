# Mortgage Assistant Agent

This example demonstrates the use of Amazon Bedrock Agents multi-agent collaboration with its built-in Routing Classifier feature. By simply enabling that mode for your supervisor, Bedrock automatically routes to the correct collaborating sub-agent using LLM intent classification optimized to route with sub-second latency. Contrast that with a traditional supervisor that must go through its own orchestration loop, a more expensive proposition that can take 3-6 seconds depending on which LLM you are using. This feature is most valuable when trying to build a unified customer experience across a set of sub-agents. In our example, we have 3 collaborators: one for general mortgage questions, one for handling conversations about Existing mortgages, and another for dealing with New mortgages.

Try sample prompts:

- "what's my balance?"
- "what are rates looking like over the past 2 weeks for new mortgages?"
- "what's your general guidance about refinancing mortgages?"

Each of these gets routed quickly to the right sub-agent for subsequent processing.
Conversation switching is seamless.

Routing also reverts automatically to full Supervisor mode if the request is truly
not mapping cleanly to a single collaborator. For example:

- "what interest rate do i have on my existing mortgage, and how does it compare to rates for new mortgages"
