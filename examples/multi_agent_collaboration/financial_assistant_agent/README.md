# Financial Analyst and Portfolio system - Multi-Agent example

## Overview
This example showcases Amazon Bedrock Agents' [multi-agent collaboration capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-multi-agents-collaboration.html) through an efficient system. 
The system consists of a supervisor agent that orchestrates two specialized sub-agents, with each sub-agent focusing on either building portfolios or gathering financial data.

## Agents Description

### Financial Agent (Supervisor)
The supervisor agent coordinates the activities of two specialized sub-agents, 
routing customer queries and requests to the appropriate agent while maintaining context and 
ensuring seamless interactions. The architecture looks as following:

### Sub-Agents

#### 1. Portfolio Agent
The Portfolio Assistant Agent performs the following key functions:

* Creates a portfolio with static data that is present with the agent for companies and uses this to create detailed revenue details and other details for the past year. 
* Stakeholder communication management via email



#### 2. Knowledge Agent
The Data Assistant Agent functions as an information repository and data retrieval specialist. Its primary responsibilities include:

* Providing data-driven insights on economic trends, company financial statements, and Federal public documents (FOMC). This is downloadable and can be uploaded to the data folder to be embedded in the knowledge base. 

* Processing and responding to user queries regarding financial data like previous year revenue, stakeholder documents of the company for every fiscal quarter, etc. This is again just static data for the purpose of our experimentation; however, we can stream real-time data using available APIs.
